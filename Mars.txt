The local ecology is abandoned Terran robots versus the native spiders. The canals are pretty, but it's cold as 
hell.
I think there's something out here watching me.
The twin moonrise/set is something to see, though.
To call this place 'resources: negligible' is to miss the opportunity to use the word 'vampiric.'
